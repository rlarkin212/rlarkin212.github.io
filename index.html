                    <h2>Problem Solving</h2>

                    <p>Through my various academic projects and during my placement year I have had to overcome problems, both people and programming based. In doing this I have learnt to take a step back and think logically and rationally through a task before moving into development</p>

                    <h2>Team Working:</h2>

                    <p>Team working is an element that is very important for the technology industry. Before university, I took an individualistic approach to projects but since completing team based projects I have learnt to effectively work as a team and have acknowledged how vital it is to have this skill in any sort of project.</p>

                    <h2>Communication:</h2>
                    <p>Through various projects I have developed my communication skills on both a one to one level as well as a team level; I have deployed this in my job as a public relations representative. Moreover I have participated in the delivery of many presentations. This shows I can adapt between formal and informal situations</p>

One will be a web based application that will act as a scrum management tool, with the other being a semi functional prototype to replace a student information system. Moreover I am also studying in the area of data analysis and using Python to create Jupyter notebooks </p>

                                <p>Throughout my placement year I developed various web apps using the .NET framework in addition to bootstrap and MySQL. The apps made use of the ability to dynamically display information using database views, as well as being able to edit database information via stored procedures and SQL statements</p>

                                <p>During my placement I created two apps for the Android platform. the first was a reporting application that used Apache Cordova to allow the user to send a report as an email automatically.

                                <p>I have also created a web based content management system using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. I also used PHP and MySQL to handle the back end functionality of the system, allowing the user log in to an admin version of the system which allowed them to change and add to elements of the site.

                                Furthermore recently I have created an e-commerce/content management system for a buy and sell website using the bootstrap framework and ASP.NET web forms. The site allows user to upload and edit items as well as allowing the user to register and communicate internally to the seller about a specific item.
